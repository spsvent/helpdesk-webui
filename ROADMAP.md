---

### 4. Email Notifications ⬜
**Status:** Planned

**Triggers:**
- New ticket created (to assignee)
- Ticket assigned/reassigned
- New comment added
- Status changed
- Approval requested/decided

**Approach:**
- Microsoft Graph API sendMail

- User preference for notification frequency

---

### 5. Bulk Actions ⬜
**Status:** Planned (Admin only)

**Actions:**
- Close multiple tickets
- Reassign multiple tickets
- Change priority/status in bulk
- Export selected tickets

**UI:**
- Checkbox selection in ticket list

---

### 6. Dashboard ⬜

**Metrics:**
- Tickets by status (pie chart)
- Tickets by department (bar chart)
- Open vs closed over time (line chart)
- Average resolution time
- Top requesters/assignees
- Overdue tickets count

**Consider:** Using Grafana instead (see #11)

---

### 7. Teams Integration ⬜

**Features:**
- Post to channel on new high-priority tickets
- Bot commands to check ticket status
- Adaptive cards for ticket summaries
- Deep links back to Help Desk app

**Approach:**

---

### 8. Mobile App ⬜
**Status:** Planned

**Options:**
1. **PWA** - Add manifest, service worker, offline support
2. **Responsive improvements** - Better mobile layout
3. **Native app** - React Native (larger effort)

**Recommended:** Start with PWA + responsive improvements

---

### 9. Dark Mode ⬜
**Status:** Planned

**Approach:**
- Add `.theme-dark` CSS variables
- Toggle in header/settings
- Respect system preference (prefers-color-scheme)
- Persist preference in localStorage

**Note:** Theme system already uses CSS variables, making this straightforward

---

### 10. SLA Tracking ⬜
**Status:** Planned

**Features:**
- Define SLA rules by priority/category
- Visual countdown/warning on approaching SLA
- Escalation notifications
- SLA breach reporting

**Example SLAs:**

| High | 4 hours | 1 day |
| Normal | 1 day | 3 days |
| Low | 2 days | 1 week |

---

### 11. Grafana Connection ⬜
**Status:** Planned

**Options:**
1. **Grafana as Dashboard** - Replace built-in dashboard entirely
2. **Hybrid** - Basic stats in-app, detailed analytics in Grafana
3. **Data export** - Push metrics to Grafana data source

**Considerations:**
